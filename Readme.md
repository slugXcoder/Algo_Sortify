## Algorithms Supported:
  1. <h2><b>Bubble Sort:</b></h2> Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It works by repeatedly comparing and swapping adjacent elements if they are in the incorrect order.
  2. <h2><b>Selection Sort:</b></h2> Selection Sort sorts an array by repeatedly identifying the minimum element from the unsorted section and moving it to the beginning.
  3. <h2><b>Insertion Sort:</b></h2> In Insertion Sort, the array is divided into a sorted and an unsorted portion. Elements from the unsorted section are inserted into their appropriate positions in the sorted section.
  4. <h2><b>Merge Sort:</b></h2> Merge Sort divides the array into two halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.
  5. <h2><b>Quick Sort:</b></h2> Quick Sort selects a pivot element and partitions the array around it. Elements smaller than the pivot are placed before it, and elements greater than the pivot are placed after it, recursively sorting the array.
  6. <h2><b>Heap Sort:</b></h2> Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a Binary Heap data structure. It works similarly to Selection Sort by finding the minimum (or maximum) element and placing it in the correct position.
